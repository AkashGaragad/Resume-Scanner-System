## 📌 Problem Statement

At **Innomatics Research Labs**, resume evaluation is currently **manual, inconsistent, and time-consuming**.  
Every week, the placement team across **Hyderabad, Bangalore, Pune, and Delhi NCR** receives **18–20 job requirements**, with each posting attracting **thousands of applications**.

Challenges with the manual process:
- ❌ Delays in shortlisting candidates.  
- ❌ Inconsistent judgments, as evaluators may interpret requirements differently.  
- ❌ High workload for placement staff, limiting focus on student interview prep.  
- ❌ Hiring companies expect **fast and high-quality** shortlists.  

Hence, there is a pressing need for an **automated system** that is **scalable, consistent, and provides actionable feedback** to students.

## 🎯 Objective

The **Automated Resume Relevance Check System** aims to:

- Automate resume evaluation against job requirements at scale.  
- Generate a **Relevance Score (0–100)** for each resume.  
- Highlight **missing skills, certifications, or projects**.  
- Provide a **fit verdict**: High / Medium / Low suitability.  
- Offer **personalized improvement feedback** to students.  
- Store evaluations in a **web-based dashboard** accessible to the placement team.  
- Handle **thousands of resumes weekly** with consistency and robustness.

## 🚀 Proposed Solution

We propose building an **AI-powered resume evaluation engine** that combines **rule-based checks** with **LLM-powered semantic understanding**.

### Key Steps
1. **Job Requirement Upload** – Placement team uploads job descriptions (JD).  
2. **Resume Upload** – Students upload resumes (PDF/DOCX).  
3. **Resume Parsing** – Extract raw text, normalize sections.  
4. **JD Parsing** – Extract job role, must-have and nice-to-have skills.  
5. **Relevance Analysis** –  
   - Hard Match: keyword & skill check (exact + fuzzy).  
   - Semantic Match: embeddings + LLM reasoning.  
   - Scoring: weighted formula for final score.  
6. **Output Generation** –  
   - Relevance Score (0–100).  
   - Missing skills/projects.  
   - Verdict: High / Medium / Low.  
   - Suggestions for improvement.  
7. **Storage & Dashboard** – Results stored in a database, accessible via a searchable web app.
