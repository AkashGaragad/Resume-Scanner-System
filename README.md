## How It Works

1. User uploads a resume file.  
2. The system ingests the file and converts to plain text.  
3. NLP / parsing modules identify entities: name, contact details, education, etc.  
4. Analysis module processes extracted text to infer strengths & weaknesses: e.g. missing skills, experience gaps, formatting issues.  
5. Results are displayed in the web UI: structured info + suggestions.
